üîÅ Dynamic List Rendering with React, HTML, and Tailwind CSS
This project includes a dynamic list rendering feature implemented using React's .map() function. It efficiently iterates over an array of data to generate and display UI components, such as cards or list items, directly in the JSX. Each rendered element is styled using Tailwind CSS, allowing for a clean and responsive design with minimal custom CSS.

Key Features:

Utilizes React's .map() for rendering data-driven components.

Tailwind CSS for consistent and modern styling.

Responsive layout that adapts across screen sizes.

Clean and modular component structure for easy maintenance.

This approach is ideal for displaying collections of items such as user profiles, products, blog posts, or any other repeatable UI content in a scalable and readable way.
